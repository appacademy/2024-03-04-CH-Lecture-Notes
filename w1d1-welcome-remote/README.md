### Logistics and Expectations
---

#### Daily Projects

+ Work on the phases in order
  + Always read the instructions for a phase all the way through before starting the project. Best to read them the night before.
+ Make sure you understand every single line of code that you write.
  + If you or your partner writes a line you do not understand, stop and try to understand it.
  + If you need to, ask a question!
+ It is more important to understand than to race to finish.
  + The projects are designed to keep thinking, building, and problem solving.  They are not necessarily designed to be finished in a day.  
  + As long as you understand every line of code you write, and you can confidently go through the learning objectives of the day, you will have accomplished everything you need each day at App Academy. 

---

#### Assessments

+ Academic Integrity
  + No notes
  + No copying
  + No sharing of assessments
  + No discussion with others during assessment
+ Violations will result in dismissal
+ Remote vs In-Person
  + Assessments will be administered through Progress Tracker. 
  + For remote assessments, each student will have their own zoom breakout room where they will screenshare.  
  + You must share your screen during these assessments; not doing so will result in a fail and dismissal
  + Instructors will proctor rmote assessments by moving between breakout monitoring assessment progress and to ensuring academic integrity.
  + For in-person assessments, all the same rules apply.  Instead of proctoring via zoom, instructors will be on the classroom floor doing the same monitoring.
+ All assessments are timed.  At the end of the alloted time, assessments will be submitted to the progress tracker for grading.


---

#### Foundations Assessments

+ There are two: W2D1 and W3D1
+ Failing either assessment will result in _deferral_ to the next cohort
+ We want to make sure you are ready before continuing to Week 3

---

#### Core Curriculum Assessments

+ There are 6 Assessments: A01 - A06
+ No consequences for failing one assessment
+ Retake if you fail a second assessment
  + One retake per person
  + The retake is given on same day
  + It is a different version of the assessment
+ Failing the retake will result in _dismissal_
+ If you pass a retake, you stay in the course.  If you fail one more additional assessment you will be dissmissed from the course.

---

#### Assessment Advice
+ Assessments are learning tools
  + Assessments are used to confirm and solidify understanding.
  + Spaced retrieval and testing are proven to aid in learning.
  + Assessments are also check points.  They confirm that you are keeping pace with the material and it makes sense for you to continue on in the course.
+ The material covered each day builds on the last
+ Everybody can score 100%
+ If you get a bug: relax, breath deep, and read the error message
+ Read the spec files

---

#### Tips For Success at a/A

+ Be present & punctual
+ Complete your work to the best of your ability
+ Complete your homwork, readings, and videos every night before the next day.
  + App Academy is a fast paced course with very specific amounts of time allotted for each day.  
  + Homework, videos, and readings make up a full third of your time with each day's concepts and material.
  + If you do not do these assignments, you're robbing yourself of 33% of your learning, and setting yourself back for the other 66% because you'll have to spend the day catching up.  
  + Stay on top of the homework and you will set yourself up for success.
+ Prioritize understanding over completion for the daily projects
+ Ask for help when you need it
+ Focus full-time on App Academy
  + App Academy is a huge commitment, but in the grand scheme of things 16 weeks is not a huge amount of time.
  + If you invest the time now and commit 100% to App Academy, you will see it payoff huge as a great career as a software engineer.

#### Growing As a Developer

+ Collaborate: 
  +Talk to one another - speak code!
+ The best thing you can learn is how to be independent

  + how to utilize Google and Stack Overflow

---

#### Code of Conduct

---

#### Pair Programming (continued)

	3) Google the error in multiple ways
	4) Call an instructor
